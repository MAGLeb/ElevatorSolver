# Elevator Problem with RF Agents

In this repository, we focus on utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RF) agents to solve the elevator problem. We explore different algorithms to train our agents, providing a rich environment for experimentation and learning.

## Features

### Core Training Environment
A foundational framework to generate various tests for training models with different parameters.

### Unity Visualization
Interactive visualization built in Unity that communicates with the Python backend. Witness the training in real-time or dive deep into the results to understand agent behavior.

### Baseline Model
A naive approach that surprisingly provides commendable results. Use this as a starting point to understand the problem before diving into more complex algorithms.

### Q-Table Algorithm
Dive deeper with the Q-Table algorithm, exploring how a tabular approach can be used to optimize the agent's decisions in the elevator problem.
